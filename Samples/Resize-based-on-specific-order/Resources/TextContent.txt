Ribbon illustrates the implementation of Office UI with Ribbon items and Backstage. Our product exposes most features of the new UI while conforming to the WPF architecture. Configuring and designing the layout is very easy when using XAML code. RibbonWindow has been implemented for giving a themed Office 2016 UI look and feel to the traditional window. Users can experience full-keyboard navigation. Key Tips are provided for faster access of items within the Ribbon. Enhanced tooltips help users use and understand the application very easily.
